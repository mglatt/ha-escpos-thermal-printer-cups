"""Register/patch printer profiles that escpos-printer-db gets wrong or lacks.

Ported from the upstream (direct-transport) integration's v1.1.0
``capabilities/custom_profiles.py``. Unlike ``profile_aliases.py`` (which
points a display name at an *existing* bundled profile), this module either
builds genuinely new profile dicts (RP820, TM-m30III) or corrects data in
place (the clone-firmware codePages dedupe below, and NT-80-V-UL's font
columns) inside ``escpos.capabilities.CAPABILITIES["profiles"]`` so the fix
applies everywhere: the config-flow dropdown, the codepage lists, and the
Dummy printer constructor (all of which resolve profile names through that
dict, either via our own loader or directly through
``escpos.profile.get_profile()``).

    Rule: for a name with multiple indices, drop the ones >= 48 *only if*

    put their real, working index at 16 while a stale/inactive duplicate

    Restricting the drop to the >=48 range only touches indices clone
    firmware can't reach anyway. "Unknown" placeholder entries are left
    untouched -- they're filtered out downstream (capabilities.py's
    ``get_profile_codepages``) regardless of which index survives, so
